# About the application
It's an application made in Java with a GUI. For storing the data i've made a mother class named Product with an ID and then 3 classes derived from the Product: Juices, Snacks and Sweets. I created a linked list where I stored my products. You can view all the products, you can sort them into categories. You can add a product and delete a product. For the graphical interface i used JavaFX. I am willing to use a database for the app because at the moment it loads data from the code.
